# Composite Pattern 🌿

## Overview 📚

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Design Principles 🛠️

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Structure 🌳

The Composite Pattern involves the following participants:

- **Component**: An interface that defines operations that can be performed on both simple and complex objects.
- **Leaf**: A class that represents a simple object with no children.
- **Composite**: A class that represents a complex object that can have children. It implements the Component interface and defines behavior for adding and removing child components.


## Benefits 🎯

- Simplifies client code by allowing uniform treatment of individual objects and compositions.
- Makes it easier to add new kinds of components.

## Drawbacks ⚠️

- Can make the design overly general.
- Might be harder to restrict the types of components that can be added.

## Conclusion 🏁

The Composite Pattern is a powerful tool for building flexible and scalable applications. By understanding and applying this pattern, you can create systems that are easier to manage and extend.
